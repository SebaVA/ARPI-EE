>This was a project which was replacing a costly, not customizable solution that accomplished half of what the project ended up being able to. It is an **open source imagining processing software** composed of a development environment for the algorithms used by the execution environment; also provided over the LAN processing as it also had a remote processing module.

>It was my project team graduation software development, which normally takes about 3 years, and was this the project that taught me the most about myself and the way I approach development. I’m proud because It made me really think if developing software solutions was my calling, broke me down, but once it was done, I could not be prouder of my achievement. It exceeded our client, our professors and after taking a step back and looking at it, our own expectations. 

**I only included the code for the execution environment as it is that one the one that has 90% of my coding for this project.**
